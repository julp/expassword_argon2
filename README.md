Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/expassword_argon2](https://hexdocs.pm/expassword_argon2).

## Options

Reasonable *options* are:

```elixir
%{
  # the algorithm between :argon2id and :argon2i
  type: :argon2_id,
  # number of threads to use
  threads: 2,
  # maximum amount of time
  time_cost: 4,
  # maximum amount of memory that may be used
  memory_cost: 131072,
}
```

(you should lower these values in config/test.exs to speed up your tests)
